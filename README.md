# IN5320 - Development in platform ecosystems (UiO)

## General information about the course

### Course content
In this course, you will learn the principles and practices of application design and development within platform ecosystems. Conceptually, you will learn about the socio-technical complexities related to large-scale information systems, and how platform architectures and ecosystems attempt to address these. Further, we look at how platform architectures and governance structures may enable distributed participation in the development of applications with user interfaces that are sensitive to local requirements within a larger system. Practically, you will develop web applications using modern, open-source frameworks and APIs.

The practical work is based on individual assignments and a major group project using the APIs of the open source platform DHIS2 (www.dhis2.org). Developed at the Department of Informatics, DHIS2 is a platform widely used for health, climate health, and education management. The group projects address real-world use-cases and needs from DHIS2 users.


### Learning outcome

<u>After you have completed this course you:</u><br>

- will have an understanding of the socio-technical complexity related to large-scale information systems that span several use-cases and contexts.

- can reflect on how platform architectures, governance, and organisational models might enable distributed development of applications that are sensitive to local requirements within a larger system.

- can reflect critically on the organisational and social implications of digital platforms.

- can prototype and develop apps for a software platform, leveraging APIs and other platform resources.
will have insight into the development of web-based software with JavaScript and HTML, using modern frameworks.
will have experience with developing software in a team.

      <strong>Assignment 1</strong><br>
      CV in HTML & CSS + Vanilla JavaScript
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 8px;">
      For the first assignment, I created a personal CV using semantic HTML and custom CSS,
      focusing on clean structure, responsive design, and accessibility.<br>
      I also practiced basic vanilla JavaScript to add simple interactive elements.

      React Web App (DHIS2 API)
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 8px;">
      In this assignment, I developed a React-based web application that retrieves
      country information from the DHIS2 API. The app displays the data in a dynamic table
      with sorting and filtering, and strengthened my understanding of API integration,
      state management, and React component architecture.

      DHIS2 Metadata Exploration App
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 8px;">
      For the final assignment, I built a custom DHIS2 application capable of fetching datasets
      from the DHIS2 Health API. The app allows users to explore and inspect metadata such as
      data elements, categories, and organization units. This project deepened my experience
      with the DHIS2 App Platform, API structures, and system architecture.
