# IN5320 - Development in platform ecosystems (UiO)

## Course content
In this course, you will learn the principles and practices of application design and development within platform ecosystems. Conceptually, you will learn about the socio-technical complexities related to large-scale information systems, and how platform architectures and ecosystems attempt to address these. Further, we look at how platform architectures and governance structures may enable distributed participation in the development of applications with user interfaces that are sensitive to local requirements within a larger system. Practically, you will develop web applications using modern, open-source frameworks and APIs.

The practical work is based on individual assignments and a major group project using the APIs of the open source platform DHIS2 (www.dhis2.org). Developed at the Department of Informatics, DHIS2 is a platform widely used for health, climate health, and education management. The group projects address real-world use-cases and needs from DHIS2 users.
